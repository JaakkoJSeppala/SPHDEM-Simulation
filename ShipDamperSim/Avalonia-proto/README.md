# Avalonia Ship Damper Simulation Prototype

This is a minimal Avalonia UI (.NET 8) project for prototyping a ship damper simulation tool. The application provides a main window with:

- Sliders for damper size, fill ratio, and position
- Buttons for Start, Stop, and Reset
- Plot area for roll decay and damping ratio curves
- MVVM architecture

## Getting Started

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code.
2. Restore NuGet packages.
3. Build and run the project.

## Project Structure
- MainWindow: UI layout
- ViewModels: Application logic and data binding
- Models: Simulation parameters and results

## Next Steps
- Implement simulation logic
- Connect UI to simulation
- Add data visualization
