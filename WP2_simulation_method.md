WP2: Simulation Method Development and Implementation

1. Selection and development of simulation method

- Choose a suitable numerical method (e.g., FDM, FEM, SPH) for modeling resonance phenomena.
- Develop the algorithm to enable resonance simulation in the target system.

2. Model implementation

- Implement the simulation code using the selected method (e.g., Python, C++).
- Build the necessary data structures and computational loops.

3. Parameterization and testing

- Define model parameters (e.g., masses, spring constants, damping coefficients).
- Run test simulations and verify that the model behaves as expected.

4. Validation

- Compare simulation results with analytical solutions or results from the literature.
- Document any deviations and their possible causes.

5. Documentation

- Record all choices, implementations, and test results made during WP2 in a clear and structured manner.
