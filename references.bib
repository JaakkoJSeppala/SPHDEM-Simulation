  abstract = {This paper employs multiphase flow theory to investigate the influence of different solid particle densities on the sloshing characteristics within a liquid tank. A numerical model of gas-liquid-solid multiphase flow sloshing motion within the tank was established using the Computational Fluid Dynamics-Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) coupling method, simulating the interactive coupling between the two-phase fluid and solid particles. In this context, the gas-liquid two-phase fluid is treated as a continuous phase, described under the Eulerian framework, with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method applied to capture the gas-liquid interface. Conversely, the solid particles are treated as a discrete phase, described under the Lagrangian framework. The effects of different solid particle densities on the tank sloshing characteristics were analyzed utilizing the STAR-CCM + software platform. Initially, the validity of the CFD-DEM method was confirmed by simulating classical scenarios such as a single spherical particle falling from air into water and the flow dynamics of a gas-liquid-solid three-phase dam break. Subsequently, a numerical simulation of sloshing in a pure water tank was conducted and compared with published experimental results, thereby verifying the feasibility of the numerical method for gas-liquid two-phase sloshing. Following this, a series of simulations were conducted on a pure water tank to validate the effectiveness of the numerical method for gas-liquid two-phase fluid sloshing. Subsequently, solid particles were introduced to the model, and the effect of solid particle densities on sloshing load and response under forced motion was studied. Finally, by comparing and analyzing the sloshing-induced pressure on the tank walls and the amplitude of the free surface motion across different solid particle densities and as well as different excitation frequencies, the sloshing characteristics of the solid-liquid mixed two-phase flow were investigated. The computational results indicate that an increase in solid particle density corresponds to an increase in liquid surface wave amplitude. This suggests that lighter solid particles have a greater damping effect on tank sloshing. It can be inferred that when the density of solid particles is maintained at a constant level, the closer the external excitation frequency is to the natural frequency, the more effective the sloshing suppression effect. This is attributed to the fact that, as sloshing intensifies, fluid velocity increases, resulting in greater damping due to viscosity effects, thereby enhancing the sloshing suppression.}

  abstract = {This study presents a computational method combining smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the discrete element method (DEM) to model flows containing a viscous fluid and macroscopic solid particles. The two-dimensional numerical simulations are validated by comparing the wake size, drag coefficient and local heat transfer for flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers near 100. The central focus of the work, however, is in computing flows of liquid–solid mixtures, such as the classic shear-cell experiments of Bagnold. Hence, the simulations were performed for neutrally buoyant particles contained between two plates for different solid fractions, fluid viscosities and shear rates. The tangential force resulting from the presence of particles shows an increasing dependence on the shear rate as observed in the Bagnold experiments. The normal force shows large variations with time, whose source is presently unclear but independent of the direct collisions between particles and the walls.}

title = "Smooth particle hydrodynamics and discrete element method coupling scheme for the simulation of debris flows",
abstract = "Debris flows have been widely researched during the last decades since they are catastrophic events with significant infrastructure and environmental impacts. Typically, they are composed of various materials which interactions are worth for studying, to improve the prediction of some variables, such as velocities, forces and affected areas. Constitutive models and numerical methods are fundamental in broadening the knowledge of the behaviour of these phenomena. Thus, the coupling of numerical techniques, for the different constituents of debris flow is becoming indispensable to describe the behaviour of these natural events. The coupling of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Method (DEM) is presented in this paper to show the capacity to represent the interaction of several materials at the same time. SPH is employed to represent the fluid and soil by using different constitutive models from a continuum approach. In contrast, DEM is used to represent immersed objects such as boulders and boundary conditions. In this sense, we can couple the behaviour that occurs at very different scales in a unified framework more suitable to describe the heterogeneity of debris flows. Benchmark cases were solved to validate this new approach. The simulations show good agreement with analytical solutions, experimental results and field data.",
